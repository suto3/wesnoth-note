<a id='L1' name='L1'></a>   1 \chapter<em class='brace'>{</em>Introduction<em class='brace'>}</em>
<a id='L2' name='L2'></a>   2 
<a id='L3' name='L3'></a>   3 This paper describes the general design of the gui2 project. The paper is
<a id='L4' name='L4'></a>   4 divided in several chapters:
<a id='L5' name='L5'></a>   5 \begin<em class='brace'>{</em>description<em class='brace'>}</em>
<a id='L6' name='L6'></a>   6 \item[Chapter 1] Explains why yet another document is added instead of using the
<a id='L7' name='L7'></a>   7         doxygen and a <strong class='reserved'>short</strong> history of the gui2 project.
<a id='L8' name='L8'></a>   8 \item[Chapter 2] Goes into the general design and structure of the gui2 project.
<a id='L9' name='L9'></a>   9 \item[Chapter 3] Dives deeper into certain parts of the design of certain
<a id='L10' name='L10'></a>  10         classes and algorithms.
<a id='L11' name='L11'></a>  11 \end<em class='brace'>{</em>description<em class='brace'>}</em>
<a id='L12' name='L12'></a>  12 
<a id='L13' name='L13'></a>  13 A omission in this paper is the simple story of how to add your own widgets in
<a id='L14' name='L14'></a>  14 the C++ code\footnote<em class='brace'>{</em>The WML part is described in the wiki.<em class='brace'>}</em>. I have a slightly
<a id='L15' name='L15'></a>  15 outdated paper on the subject, but decided not to add it; the paper needs
<a id='L16' name='L16'></a>  16 polishing and updates, but I've some design changes planned for the 1.9
<a id='L17' name='L17'></a>  17 development series. These changes will also change the way of adding new
<a id='L18' name='L18'></a>  18 widgets, so that paper needs to be rewritten and added after the rewrite is
<a id='L19' name='L19'></a>  19 complete.
<a id='L20' name='L20'></a>  20 
<a id='L21' name='L21'></a>  21 \section<em class='brace'>{</em>Why why why?<em class='brace'>}</em>
<a id='L22' name='L22'></a>  22 
<a id='L23' name='L23'></a>  23 Why is this document written in \LaTeX<em class='brace'>{</em><em class='brace'>}</em> instead of doxygen? The reason is
<a id='L24' name='L24'></a>  24 simple; during the development of the iterator class I felt I had to write a
<a id='L25' name='L25'></a>  25 lot. Writing much documentation in doxygen feels awkward. A lot of time is spend
<a id='L26' name='L26'></a>  26 on formatting, the number of subsections is limited (too low in my opinion).
<a id='L27' name='L27'></a>  27 Also it's not possible to document why certain functions aren't implemented, a
<a id='L28' name='L28'></a>  28 solution would be to make the function private and declared only, but that feels
<a id='L29' name='L29'></a>  29 like an ugly hack.
<a id='L30' name='L30'></a>  30 
<a id='L31' name='L31'></a>  31 Why is the document needed? In my opinion most manuals written in doxygen are
<a id='L32' name='L32'></a>  32 great as reference manuals but fail to explain how to <strong class='reserved'>do</strong> certain things with the
<a id='L33' name='L33'></a>  33 library and fail to explain why certain things are implemented in the way it is.
<a id='L34' name='L34'></a>  34 Writing a separate document separated from the code has the disadvantage of
<a id='L35' name='L35'></a>  35 getting earlier out of sync when an implementation details differs, but this can
<a id='L36' name='L36'></a>  36 be used as an advantage as well. Since it's hard to keep the details in sync,
<a id='L37' name='L37'></a>  37 it's a good reason not to dive into these details. This makes a natural
<a id='L38' name='L38'></a>  38 separation between which part should be in doxygen and which part in this
<a id='L39' name='L39'></a>  39 manual.
<a id='L40' name='L40'></a>  40 
<a id='L41' name='L41'></a>  41 Why after the above, are some parts of gui2 documented in separate pages in
<a id='L42' name='L42'></a>  42 doxygen? This indeed seems a contradiction, but it's not. Remember the first
<a id='L43' name='L43'></a>  43 paragraph stating it's annoying to write this kind of documentation in doxygen?
<a id='L44' name='L44'></a>  44 These parts are where I realized it's annoying to do it in doxygen and haven't
<a id='L45' name='L45'></a>  45 been incorporated in this document\footnote<em class='brace'>{</em>These parts are still mentioned in
<a id='L46' name='L46'></a>  46 this paper, but they refer to the doxygen documentation.<em class='brace'>}</em>.
<a id='L47' name='L47'></a>  47 
<a id='L48' name='L48'></a>  48 \section<em class='brace'>{</em>History<em class='brace'>}</em>
<a id='L49' name='L49'></a>  49 
<a id='L50' name='L50'></a>  50 The gui2 project was started late in 2007 to fix several problems I had with the
<a id='L51' name='L51'></a>  51 current gui at that time. The problems I had were:
<a id='L52' name='L52'></a>  52 \begin<em class='brace'>{</em>enumerate<em class='brace'>}</em>
<a id='L53' name='L53'></a>  53 \item When using small resolutions the gui started to look bad, since widgets
<a id='L54' name='L54'></a>  54         simply left their container and were drawn outside it.
<a id='L55' name='L55'></a>  55 \item Most of the gui was hard-coded in the C++ code and thus not configurable
<a id='L56' name='L56'></a>  56         <strong class='reserved'>for</strong> normal users.
<a id='L57' name='L57'></a>  57 \item ThemeWML, the part that allows the user to configure the layout, is not
<a id='L58' name='L58'></a>  58         well understood by the current developers.
<a id='L59' name='L59'></a>  59 \end<em class='brace'>{</em>enumerate<em class='brace'>}</em>
<a id='L60' name='L60'></a>  60 
<a id='L61' name='L61'></a>  61 This let to the following design goals:
<a id='L62' name='L62'></a>  62 
<a id='L63' name='L63'></a>  63 \begin<em class='brace'>{</em>enumerate<em class='brace'>}</em>
<a id='L64' name='L64'></a>  64 \item The gui should look well at every possible resolution and automatically
<a id='L65' name='L65'></a>  65         fit well.
<a id='L66' name='L66'></a>  66 \item Everything, or at least as much as possible should be configurable by WML.
<a id='L67' name='L67'></a>  67 \item The project needed more documentation as the current ThemeWML, and explain
<a id='L68' name='L68'></a>  68         how to create your own guis.
<a id='L69' name='L69'></a>  69 \end<em class='brace'>{</em>enumerate<em class='brace'>}</em>
<a id='L70' name='L70'></a>  70 
<a id='L71' name='L71'></a>  71 At the time of this writing the project is still work in progress\footnote<em class='brace'>{</em>It
<a id='L72' name='L72'></a>  72 was never expected to be a <strong class='reserved'>short</strong> during project.<em class='brace'>}</em> and will still take a <strong class='reserved'>while</strong> to
<a id='L73' name='L73'></a>  73 finish. The initial goals were pretty clear, and still are. On the other hand
<a id='L74' name='L74'></a>  74 how to implement certain parts turned out to be less clear.
<a id='L75' name='L75'></a>  75 
<a id='L76' name='L76'></a>  76 The library is the first time I designed a gui toolkit and like with all larger
<a id='L77' name='L77'></a>  77 projects, you need to learn from mistakes; preferably of others, but you're doomed
<a id='L78' name='L78'></a>  78 to make your own as well. The design process is an iterative one, causing some
<a id='L79' name='L79'></a>  79 parts of the design to be changed several times. At the time of
<a id='L80' name='L80'></a>  80 writing\footnote<em class='brace'>{</em>Shortly before the 1.8 release.<em class='brace'>}</em> a lot of areas feel stable,
<a id='L81' name='L81'></a>  81 but others are still planned to be rewritten. Mainly the handling of scrollbar
<a id='L82' name='L82'></a>  82 widgets feels awkward and hacky and are slated <strong class='reserved'>for</strong> a redesign.
<a id='L83' name='L83'></a>  83 
<a id='L84' name='L84'></a>  84 Other parts of the gui are still in the planning stage and not implemented yet,
<a id='L85' name='L85'></a>  85 but the project moves along at a steady pace and more features will be added in
<a id='L86' name='L86'></a>  86 the future.
<a id='L87' name='L87'></a>  87 
<a id='L88' name='L88'></a>  88 \paragraph<em class='brace'>{</em><em class='brace'>}</em>
<a id='L89' name='L89'></a>  89 
<a id='L90' name='L90'></a>  90 The history of this document also goes back a <strong class='reserved'>long</strong> time, it's mostly build from
<a id='L91' name='L91'></a>  91 various scraps of notes I have on my system. The plan was to change these notes
<a id='L92' name='L92'></a>  92 to doxygen format some day put it in the source. The problem was to find a nice
<a id='L93' name='L93'></a>  93 place in the source to <strong class='reserved'>do</strong> so.
<a id='L94' name='L94'></a>  94 
<a id='L95' name='L95'></a>  95 This lead to the fact the notes just stayed on my system and the number of
<a id='L96' name='L96'></a>  96 notes accumulated. During travelling to work I started to design some things <strong class='reserved'>for</strong>
<a id='L97' name='L97'></a>  97 the 1.9 development series and <strong class='reserved'>for</strong> the iterator class I needed a new kind of
<a id='L98' name='L98'></a>  98 document. I decided that was the final straw and started to work on writing this
<a id='L99' name='L99'></a>  99 document <strong class='reserved'>while</strong> travelling.
<a id='L100' name='L100'></a> 100 
<a id='L101' name='L101'></a> 101 Since you read this document, it's uploaded in the Wesnoth source tree. However, this
<a id='L102' name='L102'></a> 102 doesn't mean the document is complete. In fact it means more of the opposite, the
<a id='L103' name='L103'></a> 103 draft is uploaded and I can start to work on finishing the document by adding
<a id='L104' name='L104'></a> 104 the missing information.
