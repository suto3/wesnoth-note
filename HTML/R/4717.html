However, their sheer weight and bulk limits their flight ability somewhat, making them ungainly in the air. Where possible, they make use of terrain features such as hills, mountains and trees as launch points in order to gain greater height and speed.

Legends tell of a time long forgotten when their people began emerging from their underground world through caves. Nothing is known about their life prior to their arrival, or their reasons for entering the surface world, but they have been an integral part of the history of the continent since. Soon after their emergence from the underground, the dwarves entered into conflict with the original inhabitants of the land, the elves. The original reason for their dispute has been lost to history, but the two races have since fought three long wars, interrupted by a few decades of peace. During these wars the dwarves could not dislodge the elves from the deep forests in the south, but managed to consolidate their position in hills and the mountains in the north of the continent, known now as the Northlands. Since then they have constructed fantastic fortifications and settlements deep within the mountains and crags of their territory.</span>

A few more will be half-orcs, notably weaker than their big brothers, and relegated to supporting roles in combat, such as archery. The rest, often a full half of more of any litter, will be goblins. Goblins are puny and quite frail, rarely growing past the size and stature of a human child. Goblins are born into a lifetime of near-slavery to their larger kin, and used as sword-fodder in battle.

They are large, slow, simple-minded, and live extremely long lives inside deep caves or atop high mountains. The most unique characteristic of trolls is an internal vitality that sustains and heals them from within. As a result they live very different lives from almost any known creature. Trolls have few real needs: they require little food or water, and thus they have little incentive to pursue much besides protection from those who are hostile towards them. This in turn means they rarely have to worry about anything and can spend much of their time sleeping or in contemplation. Trolls have a curious affinity with nature. They do not relate with living things like elves do, but instead with earth and stone. They are also somewhat curious of their surroundings and many younger whelps even enjoy traveling and seeing the world. As trolls grow older they tend to become increasingly passive, gradually losing interest in their environment and spending more of their time sleeping in a quiet, familiar corner of their home cave. This is until they finally pass away as their bodies themselves slowly turn into lifeless statues of stone.</span>

Almost any dead creature can, by a sufficiently skilled necromancer, be reanimated and rise again in undeath.

A greater mystery of necromancy is in how constructs are sustained without continuous effort from the necromancer. An undead creature does not require the constant attention of the necromancer to command and sustain, but can work autonomously according to the commands of its master. Only rarely, perhaps once every few months, does the necromancer need to maintain his creation.</span>

The records tell of a powerful battle-mage, a brilliant tactician and practitioner of the arcane arts, who had been given the title of Dauntless by his followers. At the battle of Arcanclave, Dauntless and his armies did battle with a savage race of sorcerer-demons known as the Kah Ruuk. Surrounded by tens of thousands of Kah Ruuk, Dauntless used his magic to summon a powerful earth elemental (who, for unknown reasons, owed Dauntless a debt of gratitude). The elemental raised great stones from deep within the earth, forming them, in mere moments, into the walls and battlements of a massive fortress. Thousands of Kah Ruuk perished in their attempt to overrun Arcanclave Citadel, and Dauntless and his men were victorious that day. More than one thousand years later, the Warrior-Queen Cynsaun the First drove a clan of necromancers from the ruins of Arcanclave Citadel, and, in the years that followed, converted the region into a military stronghold. It is rumored that several powerful artifacts, remnants from the reign of the Great Mage Dauntless, may yet remain hidden, lost somewhere within the granite and obsidian walls of Arcanclave Citadel.

The Elders were preparing to make war on a human outpost, and were in great need of the powerful magics of Oxsrrsk, a Saurian Mystic who had last been seen heading in the direction of Ruaskkolin Lake. Xikkrisx found the petrified body of Oxsrrsk, along with a carefully bound scroll that had apparently been dropped into a small crevice in the cave floor. He opened the scroll and read a brief passage from the middle of the text: “After he was bound and cast from the Upper World, Chak’kso’s enraged spirit sought release, and was able to exert a corrupting influence on certain regions of the Upper World, channeled through ‘pathways of stone’ that extend from the surface into the depths of the Under Reaches. This rage altered the eggs of great lizards, shaping their bodies and spirits into implements of Chak’kso’s hatred.” Confused, Xikkrisx fixed his attention on the task at hand. Thinking that perhaps the Elders could find some way to restore Oxsrrsk, he began the long and strenuous task of hauling the statue back to the domain of the Rysssrylosszkk Clan. Exhausted, and not having traveled far from the lake, Xikkrisx set the statue down inside of a small cave, and lay down to rest. He was awoken by a bone-chilling roar."</span>

According to these histories, Chak’kso had once sought to transform all life on the planet to stone; so great was his hatred for creatures of flesh. He was ultimately defeated and bound by powerful magics, but in the centuries following his banishment (to a realm far below the surface of the world) a new breed of creature began appearing in the Histories, a breed with the ability to turn any being of flesh into stone. There was a period when these Basilisks (as they came to be known) wreaked havoc on the world of the living, turning thousands to stone. One by one, and at great cost, the Basilisks were defeated. All, it would seem, but one; the Basilisk known as “The Ney’yks,” or “The Eldest Child,” in the modern tongue. Supremely convinced of his ability to locate and bind this powerful creature into his service, Oxsrrsk set out on his journey..."</span>
