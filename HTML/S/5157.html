It was a hard and savage land, but we were tougher still, and we managed to survive settled around one of the rare oases. We had heavily fortified our village against marauders and were the largest encampment we knew of. My uncle, Tanuil, led us for many years, and trained us to be self-sufficient and strong against all enemies. A people struggling in an ocean of sand, we thought we were ready for anything. All that changed one fateful night, when the sky rained fire..."

I was not prone to dreaming, but as I slept I had a strange vision. I didn’t have long to ponder it though, because I was woken in the dark by the sound of deafening crashes, splintering wood and shouting elves. That night the sky rained flaming rocks, boulders bigger than you could imagine. They smote the landscape like lightning bolts, setting fire to whatever could burn and crushing houses, walls, and elves. There was nowhere to hide, nowhere to go for protection. I was terribly afraid, and I thought that if I tried to flee I would be smashed, so I hid and prayed to Eloh. I had never prayed before as fervently as I did that night. I heard cries and screams outside, but I could not force myself to move. Eventually the thin yellow tendrils of a sickly dawn stole over the horizon, as if Naia herself were shocked by the devastation she saw."

You will find the ruins of an ancient watch tower made of black obsidian in the desert by the edge of the hills. By that tower you will find the entrance to the tunnels you seek. Follow the smooth ancient tunnel down under the mountains and when you again see the sky and my suns, I shall contact you. But beware those who lurk in the darkness, they hide from my light, and must not be trusted. I have no power in the dark, so you are my hand of justice. Punish the non-believers.

At first, petty arguments between humans, elves and dwarves erupted into conflicts, embroiling our people in the first wars they had fought for ages. Then orcs and other foul creatures came back into the world and raided our settlements, razing villages and massacring hundreds. Uria’s followers studied the necromantic arts and raised armies of undead. Our people had grown weak and soft in the time of peace and plenty and were ill-suited to cope with these new trials. Even nature herself seemed to quail under the onslaught: crops failed, the trees sickened and our forests began to die. Most disturbing was the way the nights lengthened, creating the long dark we suffer today.
