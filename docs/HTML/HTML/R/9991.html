He was once a great sorcerer, but he coveted wealth and power. To gain his ends, he allied himself with the Lich-Lords, and from them he learned their craft. When the orcish menace first appeared on the continent and the Wesfolk fled to the east, Malifor left their service and followed. No word surfaced of his fate from then on, but it seems he became a lich himself. I am not surprised he took up residence in these mines, all these years later — he always had a love of gold, and a special hatred of me. He tried to break me into mindless slavery, but I resisted his power and fled. I have been hiding in these flooded tunnels ever since. Some monster that Malifor’s minions greatly fear lives in these waters; they do not molest me here."</span>

All the mages, sorcerers and wise men came together and cast a mountain into the sky and made it glow as bright as the sun. They sent this second sun, the one you call Naia, hurtling through the sky so that only a few hours of darkness remained each night.

Protected by their magic and their isolation, these colonists held out longer than most after the fall of the empire.

We sent several expeditions into the jungle to explore the building, but none ever returned.

But Zhangor played upon the elves’ fears and demanded more from his followers. He declared that all other elves were heretics and did not deserve life. So the Wesmere elves gave sanctuary to refugees, and then they turned them over to their dark priests, who sacrificed them on Zhangor’s bloody altars. Zhangor feasted on these sacrifices and grew stronger and more powerful. He wanted even more. When no more refugees came, the priests ordered raiding parties to go out and bring back any poor souls they could find. When no more elves could be found they preyed upon humans, dwarves, orcs, anyone they could find in the nearby lands."</span>

He flew over the land, raining down fire on defenders and attackers alike, delighting in the death and destruction. We had not the power to combat one as strong as him, and we called out to Eloh to save us in our hour of need.

We filled the entire structure with wood and oil and set the place ablaze to make sure that any remnants of Yechnagoth’s infestation would be purged by holy fire. We then tore the citadel down, stone by stone. I was tempted to save the stones for construction in the future, but I did not know what foul magics might still linger in them, and I did not want to take any chances. So with the help of the merfolk, we carried the stones far out into the water and cast them down to the bottom of the ocean.
