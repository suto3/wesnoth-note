It resembles a scraggy underground cavern which reduces efficiency of most units, but shoulders defense. Dwarves and trolls, who are main settlers of caves, have a relatively easy time navigating this terrain. Dwarves, who by dint of their small size have the full advantage of navigation in such topography.

Cavalry, however, have so much trouble navigating them that any benefit gained by stealth is negated. Elves are an exception to this general rule for forests. Not only do they possess full movement in forests, but they also gain a considerable defensive bonus. Dwarves are another exception to this rule; though they are able to plow through the forests without much loss of speed, their utter unfamiliarity with the terrain causes them to receive no defensive bonus.</span>
